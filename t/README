TEST FILES README

File::RandomLine test files and data:

01-fast-algorithm.t -- complete test of default algorithm and error handling
02-uniform-algorithm.t -- shorter tests of slow, uniform algorithm
testdata.txt -- sample data file with 4 lines for fast test
testdata2.txt -- sample data file with 4 very uneven lines for uniform test
not_readable.txt    -- empty file used for testing unreadable file failure

Two additional files are present -- these were alternate test scripts
used in writing an article about Test::MockRandom.  They are redundant with
File_RandomLine.t, but are included here for reference and because I was
testing to make sure they worked as promised.  Their extensions are 
changed to avoid being picked up by the standard "Build test" cycle.

minimal_test.pt     -- stub test with only 2 cases
longer_test.pt      -- tests single lines only, no error checking
